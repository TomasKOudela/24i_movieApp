## First
I couldn't upload node modules to GitHub because the folder would be too big so first run: npm install 

## Second

After install just run npm start

## Home page 

Home page is with four carousels through which you can iterate with click on the arrows on pc

And on phone and smaller screens you can just drag,

## Specific pages to genre

I added pages for popular movies and other genres that are displayed on the home page. 

You can iterate through pages with pagination at the bottom of the page, 

## Search

Default search is setted to Star Wars just for fun.
Result is displayed base on the value you provide in input form. 

## Last point 

I hope the app is good enough for you to consider me as a new employee.
